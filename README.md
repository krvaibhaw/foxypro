### What each file does

**`bin/main.py`** — The only file you run directly. Adds the project root to `sys.path` and calls `main_loop()` from `core.py`.

**`myshell/core.py`** — The brain of the shell. Contains the `main_loop()` REPL, the command processing pipeline (`process_command` → `process_single_command`), variable expansion via regex, and quote-aware semicolon splitting. Imports from every other module and orchestrates the full execution flow.

**`myshell/builtins.py`** — Implements every built-in command as a standalone function (`builtin_cd`, `builtin_echo`, `builtin_alias`, etc.). Also owns the `aliases` dict (the live in-memory alias table), `command_history` list, and the `load_aliases()` / `save_aliases()` persistence functions.

**`myshell/redirection.py`** — Handles everything involving `|`, `>`, `>>`, and `<`. Uses `subprocess.Popen` chains for multi-stage pipes so stdout of each process is correctly wired to stdin of the next. Checks `>>` before `>` to avoid the common operator-matching bug.

**`myshell/background.py`** — Launches a command with `subprocess.Popen` (no `wait()`) and immediately prints the PID, returning control to the shell.

**`myshell/validation.py`** — Runs before any command executes. Checks for mismatched quotes, the invalid `|>` operator, empty pipe segments, and dangling redirection operators with no filename.

**`myshell/utils.py`** — Single function `parse_command()` that detects a trailing `&` and returns `(True, command_without_ampersand)` or `(False, command)`.

**`myshell/aliases.json`** — Plain JSON file, auto-created on the first `alias` or `unalias` call. Merge-loaded on startup so default aliases are always present even if the file predates them.

## Requirements

- Python **3.10 or higher** (uses `list[str]` type hints which require 3.9+, and `match` style patterns internally)
- No pip installs, no virtual environment needed
- Works on Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+

Verify your Python version:

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

---

## Installation

**Option 1 — Clone with git:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/foxypro.git
cd foxypro
```

**Option 2 — Download ZIP:**

Download and extract the project folder, then open a terminal inside the `foxypro/` directory.

No `pip install` step is required.

---

## Getting Started

Start the shell from inside the `foxypro/` directory:

```bash
python bin/main.py
```

You will see the ASCII banner followed by the shell prompt:

```
 ********
/**/////                    **   ** ******
/**        ******  **   ** //** ** /**///**  ******  ******
/*******  **////**//** **   //***  /**  /**//**//* **////**
/**////  /**   /** //***     /**   /******  /** / /**   /**
/**      /**   /**  **/**    **    /**///   /**   /**   /**
/**      //******  ** //**  **     /**     /***   //******
//        //////  //   //  //      //      ///     //////

============================================================
  Welcome to Foxypro Shell  |  type 'help' to get started
============================================================

/home/yourname$
```

The prompt always shows your **current working directory** followed by `$`.

Type `help` to see the full command reference, or `exit` to quit.

## How a Command Gets Executed

Understanding the execution pipeline helps when debugging unexpected behaviour.

**1. Validation** (`validation.py`)
The raw input is checked for syntax errors before anything runs. If validation fails, an error is printed and execution stops — the command never reaches the shell or OS.

**2. Variable expansion** (`core.py → expand_variables`)
All `$VAR` and `${VAR}` tokens are replaced with their current values from `os.environ`. If a variable is not set, it expands to an empty string. Expansion happens on the whole command string before splitting.

**3. History recording** (`builtins.py → add_to_history`)
The expanded command is appended to the in-memory `command_history` list.

**4. Semicolon splitting** (`core.py → _split_on_semicolons`)
If the command contains `;`, it is split into individual sub-commands. The splitter is quote-aware — a `;` inside `"..."` or `'...'` is not treated as a separator. Each sub-command is then processed independently through steps 5–7.

**5. Background flag detection** (`utils.py → parse_command`)
If the command ends with `&`, `background=True` is returned and the `&` is stripped from the command string.

**6. Routing decision** (`core.py → process_single_command`)
Three possible routes:
- **Built-in, no operators** → `execute_builtin()` in `builtins.py`
- **Background** → `handle_background()` in `background.py`
- **Everything else** (external commands, redirection, pipes) → `handle_redirection()` in `redirection.py`

> **Why built-ins with operators go to `handle_redirection`:** A command like `echo hello >> file.txt` starts with `echo` which is a built-in — but it has a `>>` operator. If it were routed to `execute_builtin`, it would print `hello >> file.txt` literally. The check `is_builtin() and not _has_redirection_or_pipe()` ensures that any built-in command containing an operator is passed to the system shell via `handle_redirection`, which handles the operator correctly.

**7. Execution**
- `handle_background` — calls `subprocess.Popen` without waiting, prints the PID
- `handle_redirection` — dispatches to the correct handler (`>>` checked before `>` to avoid substring matching bugs), uses `subprocess.Popen` chains for pipes
- `execute_builtin` — calls the matching `builtin_*` function directly in Python

---

## Built-in Commands

### Navigation

#### `cd [path]`
Change the current working directory. With no argument, changes to the home directory (`~`).

```bash
cd /tmp              # go to /tmp
cd projects/myapp    # relative path
cd ..                # go up one level
cd                   # go to home directory
cd ~                 # also home directory
```

Errors handled: directory not found, not a directory, permission denied.

#### `pwd`
Print the full absolute path of the current working directory.

```bash
pwd
# /home/yourname/projects/foxypro
```

---

### File Operations

#### `ls [path]` / `dir [path]`
List the contents of a directory. Both `ls` and `dir` are accepted. On Windows the underlying command is `dir`; on Unix it is `ls`.

```bash
ls                   # list current directory
ls /tmp              # list specific directory
dir                  # same as ls
```

#### `mkdir <name>`
Create a new directory. Fails with a clear message if the directory already exists.

```bash
mkdir output
mkdir /tmp/testfolder
```

#### `rmdir <name>`
Remove a directory. Only works on **empty** directories. Fails with a message if the directory contains files.

```bash
rmdir output
rmdir /tmp/testfolder
```

#### `type <filename>`
Print the contents of a text file to stdout. Similar to Unix `cat` or Windows `type`.

```bash
type notes.txt
type /etc/hostname
```

Errors handled: file not found, is a directory.

#### `echo [text]`
Print text to stdout. With no argument, prints a blank line. Commonly used with redirection operators.

```bash
echo Hello World
echo "Spaces   are   preserved"
echo                 # blank line
echo line one > file.txt
echo line two >> file.txt
```

---

### System

#### `clear`
Clear the terminal screen. Uses `cls` on Windows and `clear` on Unix.

#### `set VAR=value`
Set an environment variable for the current session. The variable is available immediately for `$VAR` expansion and is visible to any child processes launched from the shell.

```bash
set NAME=Alice
set DEBUG=true
set PATH_PREFIX=/usr/local
echo Hello $NAME
```

Variables set this way do not persist after the shell exits. Use your OS's profile file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `System Properties`) for permanent variables.

#### `env [VAR]`
Display environment variables. With no argument, lists all variables sorted alphabetically with values truncated at 60 characters. With an argument, shows just that one variable.

```bash
env                  # show all variables
env HOME             # show just HOME
env NAME             # show a variable you set with 'set'
```

#### `history`
Show all commands entered in the current session, numbered from 1.

```bash
history
```

#### `help`
Display the full built-in command reference with color formatting.

#### `exit`
Save aliases to disk and exit the shell gracefully. Also triggered by Ctrl-D (EOF).

---

### Aliases

Aliases let you define short names for longer commands. They are stored in memory and also persisted to `myshell/aliases.json` so they survive restarts.

#### `alias`
List all currently defined aliases.

```bash
alias
# Aliases:
# ----------------------------------------
#   l           -> ls
#   ll          -> ls -la
#   greet       -> echo Hello
# ----------------------------------------
```

#### `alias <name> <command>`
Create a new alias. The command can be anything — including commands with arguments.

```bash
alias greet echo Hello
alias lspy ls | grep .py
alias myip curl ifconfig.me
alias back cd ..
```

#### `alias <name>`
Show the definition of a single alias.

```bash
alias greet
#   greet       -> echo Hello
```

#### `unalias <name>`
Remove an alias permanently (also updates `aliases.json`).

```bash
unalias greet
```

**Alias chaining:** Aliases can resolve to other aliases. If `h` is aliased to `history` and `history` is a built-in, running `h` works correctly because `execute_builtin` recursively resolves aliases.

---

## Operators & Special Syntax

### Pipe `|`

Connects the stdout of one command to the stdin of the next. Foxypro builds a proper `Popen` chain — each process starts before the previous one finishes, so output streams correctly even for large outputs.

```bash
ls | grep .py
ls | grep .txt | cat
echo "hello world" | cat
ps aux | grep python
```

Multi-stage pipes work by iterating through the pipe segments, setting each process's `stdout=PIPE` (except the last) and `stdin=prev_stdout`. The parent process closes each intermediate stdout handle after handing it to the next child, so EOF propagates correctly.

**Validation:** Empty pipe segments are caught before execution:
```bash
ls |  | grep .py    # Error: Pipe operator has an empty command segment
ls |>  file.txt     # Error: Invalid operator: |>
```

---

### Output Redirection `>`

Writes the stdout of a command to a file. **Overwrites** the file if it already exists, creates it if it does not.

```bash
echo Hello > greeting.txt
ls > filelist.txt
pwd > location.txt
```

> **Important:** `>` checks `>>` first internally to avoid the substring-matching bug where `>` would match inside `>>`.

---

### Append Redirection `>>`

Appends the stdout of a command to a file. Creates the file if it does not exist.

```bash
echo line one > log.txt
echo line two >> log.txt
echo line three >> log.txt
type log.txt
# line one
# line two
# line three
```

---

### Input Redirection `<`

Feeds the contents of a file as stdin to a command.

```bash
cat < notes.txt
sort < unsorted.txt
grep hello < bigfile.txt
```

---

### Background Execution `&`

Append `&` to any command to run it in the background. The shell prints the process PID and immediately returns the prompt.

```bash
sleep 10 &
# Started process 12345 in background

echo still responsive    # runs immediately
```

Background processes are fully detached — the shell does not wait for them or track their exit code. Use your OS's process tools (`ps`, `Task Manager`) to monitor them.

---

### Command Chaining `;`

Run multiple commands on one line, in order. Each command runs regardless of whether the previous one succeeded or failed.

```bash
echo one; echo two; echo three

mkdir demo; cd demo; pwd; cd ..; rmdir demo

set X=10; echo $X; set X=20; echo $X
```

**Quote awareness:** Semicolons inside quoted strings are not treated as separators:

```bash
echo "hello; world"      # prints: hello; world  (not split)
echo 'a;b;c'             # prints: a;b;c  (not split)
```

---

### Variable Expansion `$VAR`

Environment variables are expanded before a command executes. Two syntaxes are supported:

```bash
set CITY=London
echo $CITY           # London
echo ${CITY}         # London  (brace syntax — safer in compound strings)
echo ${CITY}Bridge   # LondonBridge
```

If a variable is not set, it expands to an empty string (no error):

```bash
echo $NOTSET         # prints a blank line
```

Expansion uses a regex substitution (`re.sub`) that processes `${VAR}` before `$VAR` to avoid partial matches in compound expressions.

---

## Persistent Aliases

### How Persistence Works

Every time you run `alias <name> <cmd>` or `unalias <name>`, the full `aliases` dict is immediately serialized to `myshell/aliases.json` using `json.dump`. This means aliases are safe even if the shell crashes — the file is always up to date.

On startup, `load_aliases()` reads the file and calls `aliases.update(saved)`. Using `update` rather than replacing the dict means the hardcoded defaults are preserved even if the file was created by an older version that didn't include them.

Aliases are also saved on clean exit (`exit` command or Ctrl-D) as a final flush.

**Lifecycle:**

```
Startup
  └── load_aliases()
        └── aliases.update({ ...saved from disk... })

User runs: alias greet echo Hello
  └── aliases['greet'] = 'echo Hello'
  └── save_aliases()   ← writes aliases.json immediately

User runs: unalias greet
  └── del aliases['greet']
  └── save_aliases()   ← writes aliases.json immediately

User types: exit
  └── save_aliases()   ← final flush
  └── print("Goodbye!")
```

### Default Aliases

These are built into `builtins.py` and are always available, even before `aliases.json` exists:

| Alias | Expands to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `l` | `ls` | Quick directory listing |
| `ll` | `ls -la` | Detailed listing with hidden files |
| `cls` | `clear` | Windows-style clear |
| `p` | `pwd` | Quick working directory |
| `h` | `history` | Quick history |
| `mk` | `mkdir` | Quick make directory |
| `rm` | `rmdir` | Quick remove directory |

### Manually Editing aliases.json

The file is plain JSON located at `myshell/aliases.json`. You can edit it directly in any text editor:

```json
{
  "l": "ls",
  "ll": "ls -la",
  "cls": "clear",
  "p": "pwd",
  "h": "history",
  "mk": "mkdir",
  "rm": "rmdir",
  "greet": "echo Hello",
  "lspy": "ls | grep .py",
  "back": "cd .."
}
```

Changes take effect the next time the shell starts. If the file contains invalid JSON the shell will print a warning and continue with just the default aliases.

---

## Environment Variables

Variables set with `set` are written to `os.environ`, making them available to all child processes (external commands, background processes, piped commands) launched from the shell in that session.

```bash
set API_URL=https://api.example.com
set DEBUG=1
set MAX_RETRIES=3

echo $API_URL
curl $API_URL/health         # external command uses the variable
```

Variables do **not** persist after the shell exits. They are session-scoped only.

**Show all variables:**
```bash
env
```

**Show one variable:**
```bash
env HOME
env PATH
env API_URL
```

---

## Command Validation

Foxypro validates every command before executing it. Errors are printed in red and the command is not run.

| Check | Example that fails | Error message |
|---|---|---|
| Empty command | *(just pressing Enter)* | `Empty command` |
| Mismatched double quotes | `echo "bad` | `Mismatched double quotes` |
| Mismatched single quotes | `echo 'bad` | `Mismatched single quotes` |
| Invalid operator | `cmd \|> file` | `Invalid operator: \|>` |
| Empty pipe segment | `ls \|  \| grep x` | `Pipe operator has an empty command segment` |
| Dangling `>` | `echo hi >` | `Redirection operator has no target filename` |
| Dangling `>>` | `echo hi >>` | `Redirection operator has no target filename` |
| Dangling `<` | `cat <` | `Input redirection has no source filename` |

Escaped quotes (`\"`, `\'`) are not counted as quote openers/closers, so they don't trigger false positives.

---

## Command History

All commands entered in the current session are recorded in an in-memory list. View them with:

```bash
history
```

Output:

```
Command History:
------------------------------------------------------------
   1  pwd
   2  ls
   3  set NAME=Alice
   4  echo Hello $NAME
   5  mkdir demo
   6  cd demo
   7  pwd
   8  cd ..
   9  rmdir demo
  10  history
------------------------------------------------------------
```

History records the **expanded** form of commands (after `$VAR` substitution). History is session-only and resets on exit.

---

## Color Output

Foxypro uses ANSI escape codes for colored terminal output. Colors are defined in the `Colors` class in `builtins.py`:

| Color | Used for |
|---|---|
| Green (`\033[92m`) | Success messages (✓ Created, ✓ Set, ✓ Alias created) |
| Red (`\033[91m`) | Error messages (✗ not found, ✗ failed) |
| Yellow (`\033[93m`) | Warnings (no history, no aliases) |
| Cyan (`\033[96m`) | Values, names, highlighted items |
| Blue (`\033[94m`) | `pwd` output, section headers |
| Bold (`\033[1m`) | Section headings in `help` and `history` |

Colors are applied through format strings like:
```python
print(f"{Colors.OKGREEN}✓ Created directory: {path}{Colors.ENDC}")
```

`Colors.ENDC` (`\033[0m`) resets all formatting after each colored segment.

---

## Error Handling

Foxypro handles errors at every layer without crashing:

- **Validation errors** — printed before execution, command is skipped
- **Built-in errors** — caught per-function with specific messages (`FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, `OSError`)
- **Subprocess errors** — `CalledProcessError` is caught and the exit code is reported
- **KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl-C)** — cancels the current input line, returns to prompt
- **EOFError (Ctrl-D)** — saves aliases and exits gracefully
- **Unexpected exceptions** — caught at the top level of `main_loop` and printed without crashing the shell

---

## Platform Behaviour

| Feature | Windows | macOS / Linux |
|---|---|---|
| `ls` / `dir` | Runs `dir` | Runs `ls` |
| `clear` | Runs `cls` | Runs `clear` |
| `cd` with no args | Goes to `%USERPROFILE%` | Goes to `~` |
| Subprocess shell | `shell=True` (required on Windows) | `shell=True` |
| Background (`&`) | Supported via `Popen` | Supported via `Popen` |
| Pipes | Supported via `Popen` chain | Supported via `Popen` chain |
| `aliases.json` path | `myshell\aliases.json` | `myshell/aliases.json` |

---

## Practical Examples

**Build a project log:**
```bash
echo Build started > build.log
echo Compiling... >> build.log
echo Done >> build.log
type build.log
```

**Find Python files:**
```bash
ls | grep .py
```

**Set up a working environment:**
```bash
set PROJECT=myapp
set ENV=development
echo Starting $PROJECT in $ENV mode
cd $PROJECT
```

**Create a directory structure:**
```bash
mkdir src; mkdir tests; mkdir docs; ls
```

**Run a slow command without blocking:**
```bash
python long_script.py &
echo Script is running in background, PID printed above
```

**Create and use multiple aliases:**
```bash
alias pyfiles ls | grep .py
alias goback cd ..
alias here pwd
alias show type

pyfiles          # list .py files
here             # show where you are
show notes.txt   # read a file
goback           # go up a level
```

**Chain a full workflow:**
```bash
mkdir output; echo Hello > output/hello.txt; echo World >> output/hello.txt; type output/hello.txt
```

## Module Reference

### `core.py`

| Function | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `main_loop` | `() → None` | Starts the REPL. Loads aliases, runs input loop, handles Ctrl-C / Ctrl-D |
| `process_command` | `(command: str) → None` | Full pipeline: validate → expand → history → chain → dispatch |
| `process_single_command` | `(command: str) → None` | Routes one command to builtin / background / redirection |
| `expand_variables` | `(command: str) → str` | Replaces `$VAR` / `${VAR}` with `os.environ` values |
| `_split_on_semicolons` | `(command: str) → list[str]` | Quote-aware split on `;` |
| `_has_redirection_or_pipe` | `(command: str) → bool` | Returns True if `\|`, `>`, `>>`, or `<` present |

### `builtins.py`

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `load_aliases()` | Reads `aliases.json` and merges into `aliases` dict |
| `save_aliases()` | Writes current `aliases` dict to `aliases.json` |
| `is_builtin(command)` | Returns True if first word is a built-in or alias |
| `execute_builtin(command)` | Dispatches to the correct `builtin_*` function |
| `add_to_history(command)` | Appends command to `command_history` |
| `builtin_cd(args)` | Change directory |
| `builtin_ls(args)` | List directory |
| `builtin_alias(args)` | Create or display aliases |
| `builtin_set(args)` | Set environment variable |
| `builtin_env(args)` | Display environment variables |
| `builtin_history()` | Print command history |

### `redirection.py`

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `handle_redirection(command)` | Dispatcher — routes to the correct handler |
| `run_simple(command)` | Plain command, no operators |
| `handle_write_redirect(command)` | Handles `>` (overwrite) |
| `handle_append_redirect(command)` | Handles `>>` (append) |
| `handle_input_redirect(command)` | Handles `<` (stdin from file) |
| `handle_pipe(command)` | Multi-stage pipe using `Popen` chains |

### `validation.py`

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `validate_command(command)` | Returns `(bool, message)` — True if command is syntactically valid |
| `print_error(message)` | Prints error in red |

### `utils.py`

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `parse_command(command)` | Returns `(background: bool, command: str)` — strips trailing `&` |

## Known Limitations

- **`rmdir` requires empty directories.** For recursive deletion use the system command directly (e.g., `rm -rf dirname` on Unix).
- **No tab completion.** Pressing Tab does nothing. File and command names must be typed in full.
- **No arrow-key history navigation.** Up/down arrows do not cycle through previous commands the way bash/zsh do.
- **Redirection filename parsing is simple.** The split is on the first occurrence of the operator — filenames containing `>` or `<` in their name are not supported.
- **`set` is session-only.** Environment variables set with `set` are lost on exit. There is no equivalent of `.bashrc` integration.
- **Alias chains are limited to one level** in some edge cases. A deeply nested alias loop could cause infinite recursion; no cycle detection is implemented.
- **No job control.** Background processes (`&`) cannot be brought back to the foreground (`fg`) or suspended (`bg`). Use the OS task manager.
- **No globbing.** Wildcards like `ls *.py` are passed to the underlying shell via `subprocess` with `shell=True`, so they may work on Unix but behaviour varies by platform.
