# 🦊 Foxypro Shell

A lightweight, cross-platform interactive shell built entirely in Python with zero external dependencies. Foxypro provides a familiar terminal experience with built-in commands, piping, redirection, background processes, environment variables, command chaining, and persistent aliases — all implemented from scratch using only the Python standard library.

### What each file does

**`bin/main.py`** — The only file you run directly. Adds the project root to `sys.path` and calls `main_loop()` from `core.py`.

**`myshell/core.py`** — The brain of the shell. Contains the `main_loop()` REPL, the command processing pipeline (`process_command` → `process_single_command`), variable expansion via regex, and quote-aware semicolon splitting. Imports from every other module and orchestrates the full execution flow.

**`myshell/builtins.py`** — Implements every built-in command as a standalone function (`builtin_cd`, `builtin_echo`, `builtin_alias`, etc.). Also owns the `aliases` dict (the live in-memory alias table), `command_history` list, and the `load_aliases()` / `save_aliases()` persistence functions.

**`myshell/redirection.py`** — Handles everything involving `|`, `>`, `>>`, and `<`. Uses `subprocess.Popen` chains for multi-stage pipes so stdout of each process is correctly wired to stdin of the next. Checks `>>` before `>` to avoid the common operator-matching bug.

**`myshell/background.py`** — Launches a command with `subprocess.Popen` (no `wait()`) and immediately prints the PID, returning control to the shell.

**`myshell/validation.py`** — Runs before any command executes. Checks for mismatched quotes, the invalid `|>` operator, empty pipe segments, and dangling redirection operators with no filename.

**`myshell/utils.py`** — Single function `parse_command()` that detects a trailing `&` and returns `(True, command_without_ampersand)` or `(False, command)`.

**`myshell/aliases.json`** — Plain JSON file, auto-created on the first `alias` or `unalias` call. Merge-loaded on startup so default aliases are always present even if the file predates them.

## Installation

**Option 1 — Clone with git:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/foxypro.git
cd foxypro
```

**Option 2 — Download ZIP:**

Download and extract the project folder, then open a terminal inside the `foxypro/` directory.

No `pip install` step is required.

---

## Getting Started

Start the shell from inside the `foxypro/` directory:

```bash
python bin/main.py
```

You will see the ASCII banner followed by the shell prompt:

```
 ********
/**/////                    **   ** ******
/**        ******  **   ** //** ** /**///**  ******  ******
/*******  **////**//** **   //***  /**  /**//**//* **////**
/**////  /**   /** //***     /**   /******  /** / /**   /**
/**      /**   /**  **/**    **    /**///   /**   /**   /**
/**      //******  ** //**  **     /**     /***   //******
//        //////  //   //  //      //      ///     //////

============================================================
  Welcome to Foxypro Shell  |  type 'help' to get started
============================================================

/home/yourname$
```

The prompt always shows your **current working directory** followed by `$`.

Type `help` to see the full command reference, or `exit` to quit.

## How a Command Gets Executed

Understanding the execution pipeline helps when debugging unexpected behaviour.

**1. Validation** (`validation.py`)
The raw input is checked for syntax errors before anything runs. If validation fails, an error is printed and execution stops — the command never reaches the shell or OS.

**2. Variable expansion** (`core.py → expand_variables`)
All `$VAR` and `${VAR}` tokens are replaced with their current values from `os.environ`. If a variable is not set, it expands to an empty string. Expansion happens on the whole command string before splitting.

**3. History recording** (`builtins.py → add_to_history`)
The expanded command is appended to the in-memory `command_history` list.

**4. Semicolon splitting** (`core.py → _split_on_semicolons`)
If the command contains `;`, it is split into individual sub-commands. The splitter is quote-aware — a `;` inside `"..."` or `'...'` is not treated as a separator. Each sub-command is then processed independently through steps 5–7.

**5. Background flag detection** (`utils.py → parse_command`)
If the command ends with `&`, `background=True` is returned and the `&` is stripped from the command string.

**6. Routing decision** (`core.py → process_single_command`)
Three possible routes:
- **Built-in, no operators** → `execute_builtin()` in `builtins.py`
- **Background** → `handle_background()` in `background.py`
- **Everything else** (external commands, redirection, pipes) → `handle_redirection()` in `redirection.py`

> **Why built-ins with operators go to `handle_redirection`:** A command like `echo hello >> file.txt` starts with `echo` which is a built-in — but it has a `>>` operator. If it were routed to `execute_builtin`, it would print `hello >> file.txt` literally. The check `is_builtin() and not _has_redirection_or_pipe()` ensures that any built-in command containing an operator is passed to the system shell via `handle_redirection`, which handles the operator correctly.

**7. Execution**
- `handle_background` — calls `subprocess.Popen` without waiting, prints the PID
- `handle_redirection` — dispatches to the correct handler (`>>` checked before `>` to avoid substring matching bugs), uses `subprocess.Popen` chains for pipes
- `execute_builtin` — calls the matching `builtin_*` function directly in Python

# Built-in Commands

### Navigation

#### `cd [path]`
Change the current working directory. With no argument, changes to the home directory (`~`).

```bash
cd /tmp              # go to /tmp
cd projects/myapp    # relative path
cd ..                # go up one level
cd                   # go to home directory
cd ~                 # also home directory
```

Errors handled: directory not found, not a directory, permission denied.

#### `pwd`
Print the full absolute path of the current working directory.

```bash
pwd
# /home/yourname/projects/foxypro
```

---

### File Operations

#### `ls [path]` / `dir [path]`
List the contents of a directory. Both `ls` and `dir` are accepted. On Windows the underlying command is `dir`; on Unix it is `ls`.

```bash
ls                   # list current directory
ls /tmp              # list specific directory
dir                  # same as ls
```

#### `mkdir <name>`
Create a new directory. Fails with a clear message if the directory already exists.

```bash
mkdir output
mkdir /tmp/testfolder
```

#### `rmdir <name>`
Remove a directory. Only works on **empty** directories. Fails with a message if the directory contains files.

```bash
rmdir output
rmdir /tmp/testfolder
```

#### `type <filename>`
Print the contents of a text file to stdout. Similar to Unix `cat` or Windows `type`.

```bash
type notes.txt
type /etc/hostname
```

Errors handled: file not found, is a directory.

#### `echo [text]`
Print text to stdout. With no argument, prints a blank line. Commonly used with redirection operators.

```bash
echo Hello World
echo "Spaces   are   preserved"
echo                 # blank line
echo line one > file.txt
echo line two >> file.txt
```

---

### System

#### `clear`
Clear the terminal screen. Uses `cls` on Windows and `clear` on Unix.

#### `set VAR=value`
Set an environment variable for the current session. The variable is available immediately for `$VAR` expansion and is visible to any child processes launched from the shell.

```bash
set NAME=Alice
set DEBUG=true
set PATH_PREFIX=/usr/local
echo Hello $NAME
```

Variables set this way do not persist after the shell exits. Use your OS's profile file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `System Properties`) for permanent variables.
#### `env [VAR]`
Display environment variables. With no argument, lists all variables sorted alphabetically with values truncated at 60 characters. With an argument, shows just that one variable.

```bash
env                  # show all variables
env HOME             # show just HOME
env NAME             # show a variable you set with 'set'
```

#### `history`
Show all commands entered in the current session, numbered from 1.

```bash
history
```

#### `help`
Display the full built-in command reference with color formatting.

#### `exit`
Save aliases to disk and exit the shell gracefully. Also triggered by Ctrl-D (EOF).

---


### Aliases

Aliases let you define short names for longer commands. They are stored in memory and also persisted to `myshell/aliases.json` so they survive restarts.

#### `alias`
List all currently defined aliases.

```bash
alias
# Aliases:
# ----------------------------------------
#   l           -> ls
#   ll          -> ls -la
#   greet       -> echo Hello
# ----------------------------------------
```

#### `alias <name> <command>`
Create a new alias. The command can be anything — including commands with arguments.

```bash
alias greet echo Hello
alias lspy ls | grep .py
alias myip curl ifconfig.me
alias back cd ..
```

#### `alias <name>`
Show the definition of a single alias.

```bash
alias greet
#   greet       -> echo Hello
```

#### `unalias <name>`
Remove an alias permanently (also updates `aliases.json`).

```bash
unalias greet
```
